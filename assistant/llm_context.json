    "Alex:Hey! Long time no see! How’s your summer break going?",
    "Hari:Alex! It’s been forever. Summer’s going great so far. I went camping with my family last week. We went up to the mountains, pitched a tent, and basically lived off s’mores for three days. Only downside? Zero phone signal. I felt so disconnected!",
    "Alex:Oh man, I bet that was tough, no scrolling through socials. But it also sounds kind of peaceful, no notifications buzzing every two minutes. Did you do any hiking while you were out there?",
    "Hari:Yeah, we hiked this huge trail that led to a waterfall. It was incredible, but I’m still sore from all that walking. Totally worth it, though. Being out there felt like a detox from city life, you know? What about you? What have you been up to this summer?",
    "Alex:That sounds amazing, actually. I’ve been taking it easy, honestly. After that crazy school year, I just needed some downtime. I binged a bunch of Netflix shows, hit the gym a little, and went on a beach trip with my cousins last weekend.",
    "Hari:Nice! Which shows have you been watching? I’ve been meaning to catch up on a few, but I keep getting sidetracked.",
    "Alex:I finally finished Stranger Things, and now I’m hooked on The Bear. It’s so intense but in a good way. The characters feel so real. You should definitely check it out. What about you? Any plans for the rest of the break?",
    "Hari:Oh man, I’ve heard so much about The Bear! I’ll add it to my list. As for plans, I’ve got a music festival lined up next month. It’s got a killer lineup — some indie bands, a few headliners like The Strokes. I’m so pumped. You should come!",
    "Alex:That sounds amazing! I haven’t been to a music festival in so long. Where’s it happening?",
    "Hari:It’s just outside the city, like a two-hour drive. They’ve got camping there, too, so we could make it a weekend thing. You in?",
    "Alex:That sounds super tempting. I’ll check my schedule, but I’m down if I can swing it! It would be such a fun way to end the summer.",
    "Hari:Totally! Plus, we could meet up with a few friends there and make it a mini-reunion. It feels like we hardly ever get to see each other during the school year anymore.",
    "Alex:True! Everyone’s been so busy lately. It would be cool to just hang out, relax, and not worry about assignments or deadlines for once. What else is on your summer bucket list? I feel like you’re always doing something interesting.",
    "Hari:Ha, trying to! I’ve got a few things I wanna cross off. I’m thinking of taking a pottery class next week. Random, I know, but I’ve always wanted to try it. And maybe a road trip before the summer’s over — I’m itching to see something new. How about you? Anything you’re looking forward to?",
    "Alex:Pottery sounds fun! You’ll have to show me whatever masterpiece you make. For me, I really want to get into photography more. I bought this old film camera at a thrift store, and I’ve been messing around with it. It’s a whole different vibe from taking pics on my phone. I’m hoping to capture some cool shots before summer’s over.",
    "Hari:That sounds so cool! I’ve always wanted to try film photography. It’s like everything looks more nostalgic on film, right? You should bring your camera if we do that festival — I bet you’d get some epic shots.",
    "Alex:That’s actually a great idea! I hadn’t thought of that. I’ll definitely bring it if we go. So, should we grab ice cream later this week? I heard about this new spot downtown that everyone’s raving about.",
    "Hari:Yesss, I’m always down for ice cream. How about Thursday afternoon? We can meet up, catch up some more, and maybe plan out that festival.",
    "Alex:Thursday works! Let’s do it. I’ll text you the details, and we’ll figure it out from there. I’m excited to finally hang out.",
    "Hari:Same! It feels like it’s been forever. Alright, catch you later! And don’t forget to bring some of those film shots for me to see!",
    "Alex:Deal. Talk soon!"
